# Proposal

## Idea summary
We are generating a random Sudoku game with using API call to 'https://github.com/berto/sugoku' and Javascript to generate the playing board. 
The unsolved squares will be covered with randomly generated images using the giphy images API until the user clicks on the square to enter their number. 

## Proposed Developer Roles
Michael will be the main developer for the HTML Sudoku board and setup the initial application interface. 

Senyo will start on the Javascript for the puzzle solution and rules of Sudoku. Eventually we will all work on the logic of the Sudoku game rules and the solution. 

Tony will be working on the CSS and aesthetics piece of the Sudoku Application. 

## Proposed CSS framework
Foundation Framework

## Proposed Server-Side APIs/Third Party APIs
https://sugoku2.herokuapp.com/ - for randomly generated Sudoku numbers
https://giphy.com - for random images on unsolved squares

## Link to project board with User Story
https://github.com/code-monkey713/project-one/projects/1
End user will be presented with an option to select the difficulty of the Sudoku Game.
A randomly generated game board will be presented from the difficulty selected. 
An instruction page with Sudoku game rules will appear. 
User will see randomly generated images for unsolved squares. 
User will play the game following normal Sudoku rules. 
There will be a check solution button and if the numbers are all correct: they are a smart person.
